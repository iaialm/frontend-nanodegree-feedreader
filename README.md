# How will I complete this project?
first of all i opend the file and explore it , then i found the first test ,and it was a guide for me to do the other tests , i search a lot and be insbired by many projects 

first test was to loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

secondly i wrote  a test to loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

thurd test is Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`.

and Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.

then Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. 

then i wrote  a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.

Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.

also i wrote a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.

 and Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
